# Tables to generate figures

Most Figures can be generated with the supplementary tables directly. We also put some intermediate tables here.

## Note
- Some keywords in file were not the same as in the manuscript.

    | in file | in manuscript|
    |-- | --|
    | loose | relaxed |
    | strict | stringent |
    | best | strictest |

    The other terms should be easy to understand.

- `NA`: not available.
