# Comet param files
Need to pay attention to the comet versions. There might be some change if different version of Comet was used.

The parameters were consistent for most versions. There might be some tiny changes, but for the versions we used, we didn't find any differences.

File `comet.params.decoy.HCD` was used in the first round of MS/MS search to select MS runs and PRIDE projects.

File `comet.params.NoDecoySearch.NoCut.HCD` was used in the second round of MS/MS search to select candidate novel peptides and the third round of MS/MS search to identify novel peptides.
